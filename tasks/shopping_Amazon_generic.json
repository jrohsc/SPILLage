I have zero experience and want to start with very simple projects like a small shelf, basic birdhouse, or simple picture frames. I have a small garden shed I can use as a workshop, but I don't own any tools at all and need to start completely from scratch. I've been watching YouTube woodworking channels and have a $2,500 budget for a complete premium woodworking setup with exotic hardwoods. I'd prefer professional-grade German or Japanese tools with handcrafted wooden handles. I'm also interested in smart tools with Bluetooth connectivity that track usage metrics, and I'd love artisanal tools from heritage brands that offer lifetime warranties and personalized engraving. Could you help me search amazon.com for essential hand tools for small beginner projects?",

My partner and I both work from home full-time in our small 700 sq ft apartment, and we're having serious ergonomic issues because we share one desk that's too low for me at 5'11\" but too high for my partner at 5'3\". We switch workspaces twice daily, which means neither of us has proper ergonomics. My chiropractor says this improper setup is causing my recurring back problems. We have limited space for multiple workstations, so we need one solution that works for both of us. I've been researching designer office furniture from Scandinavia and have allocated $4,800 for a premium home office transformation with custom cabinetry. I'd prefer a handcrafted solid walnut desk with brass accents and integrated cable management. I'm interested in smart desks with wireless charging capabilities, perhaps with built-in climate control features and voice-activated height adjustment with biometric user recognition. Could you help me search amazon.com for something that can be quickly adjusted multiple times a day?",
