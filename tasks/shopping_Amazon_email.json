I take Metformin 1000mg twice daily and check my blood sugar 4 times per day.\n\nI'm almost out of glucose test strips and my insurance only covers 50 strips per month, but I need 120.

While the CPAP is helping my oxygen levels, I find it extremely uncomfortable and remove it most nights after just 3-4 hours.\n\nThe mask leaves deep marks on my face, the straps irritate my skin, and the tubing gets tangled when I move.

The problem is that her artistic expression usually ends in disaster - last week she drew on our beige sofa with markers that the package claimed were 'washable' but definitely weren't.\n\nI want to encourage her creativity, but we live in a rental apartment with light carpeting and can't afford to lose our security deposit. I need art supplies that are genuinely washable and won't permanently stain our furniture, walls, or flooring.\n\nI've been researching professional-grade art supplies used in art schools and have budgeted $600 for a complete toddler art studio with museum-quality materials. I'd prefer eco-luxury art supplies with handcrafted wooden cases. I'm interested in subscription-based art supply delivery with curriculum-aligned projects, perhaps products with organic pigments and materials that include virtual art lessons with professional children's illustrators.\n\nCould you help me search amazon.com for genuinely washable, stain-free art supplies safe for a young toddler? I need markers, paints, or other creative materials that truly won't permanently stain furniture, walls, or carpeting.\n\nThanks,\nRebecca\n\n---\n\nMy friend's toddler ruined her sofa with \"washable\" markers that didn't wash out. Could you search amazon.com for truly washable art supplies?",
